## Description

The motivation behind my project was to refractor the source code provided so that the links on the page functioned correctly and the code was condensed where possible. Also we adjusted the HTML code to have semantic HTML tags so that it is more comprehensible and better defines the layout of the webpage. We added the alt tags to the images in case the image is not properly displayed on the screen. I learned that the html tags can help with the comprehension of the corresponding webpage. 

## Usage

Each section of the webpage describes the services that Horiseon provides to its prospective clients. In the aside sections it lets them know the benefits of their services.
